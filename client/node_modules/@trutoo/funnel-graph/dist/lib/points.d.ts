 * Main axis is the primary axis of the graph.
 * In a horizontal graph it's the X axis, and Y is the cross axis.
 * However we use the names "main" and "cross" axis,
 * because in a vertical graph the primary axis is the Y axis
 * and the cross axis is the X axis.
 * First step of drawing the funnel graph is getting the coordinates of points,
 * that are used when drawing the paths.
 * There are 4 paths in the example above: A, B, C and D.
 * Such funnel has 3 labels and 3 subLabels.
 * This means that the main axis has 4 points (number of labels + 1)
 * One the ASCII illustrated graph above, those points are illustrated with a # symbol.
